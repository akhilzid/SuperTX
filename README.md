# SuperTX

Currently working with FLYSKY CT6B + arduino Mega + SSD1306 Based IIC / I2C OLED (128x64 Pixels)

Done:
Now trim works through software(actual ct6b can only trimmed mechanically before) like other radios .
End points can be adjust through menu.
Can assign any channel to any stick via menu.
Can reverse channels via menu.
Can change up to 6 flight modes for APM (2x3position switches)
Up to 9 channel works corresponding rx (before it was a 6 channel radio).
Added calibration mode (all sticks end points and center point will calibrate to min 1000 , mid 1500 and max 2000)
Works fine with 2S - 3S LiPo (6V- 13V)
